# KeenStats

- keenstats.com is a landing for keenstats biz and also the host for analytics.js and analytics.dart
- keenstats.com will eventually have the admin dashboard dash.keenstats.com
- from the keenstats.com users can sign up to have an account for analytics tracking
- dash.keenstats.com will be what the customer use to add/update/delete apps, watch live analytics, download historical data
- currently redsprint.io/analytics is used but this need to migrate
